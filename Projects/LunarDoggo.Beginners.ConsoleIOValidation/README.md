# ConsoleIO
A simple console application that writes to the console-window and reads input from the user. Depending on the users input, different outputs are given.

At first the user receives a list of games to the console-window. Afterwards the application prompts the user to select the index of a game they want to play. If the user inserts a valid index, the program prints the name of the game to the console, if the user inserts an invalid index or any non-numeric character, the application prompts the user again for an index. After the game-choice is printed, the program waits for any key to be pressed and finally terminates.
