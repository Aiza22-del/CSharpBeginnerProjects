# ConsoleIO
A simple console application that writes to the console-window and reads input from the user. Depending on the users input, different execution-paths can be chosen.

First the user is greeted by a simple message and is prompted to input their name. If the input is empty or just consists of whitespaces, the program tells the user, that it didn't get a valid name, otherwise, the user is called by their name and wished a great day. Lastly, the application waits for any key to be pressed and terminates afterwards
